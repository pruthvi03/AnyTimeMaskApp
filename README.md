# AnyTimeMaskApp

As the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the country, more stringent containment measures are being put into place. From social distancing to workplace, school and day-care closures, our nation, and the world are coming together to fight this pandemic.

“Anti COVID-Any Time Mask”, as the name suggests, the purpose of our start-up is to contribute towards the path recovery from the crisis. It can be implemented to do what is needed to help curb the spread and ensure the safety and health of our communities, thereby flattening the COVID-19 curve. 

The ultimate goal of our start-up would be to facilitate the people to get the much- needed medical face masks, easily and conveniently. We aim to devise portable, contactless, self-service mask collection dispensers, which can be deployed at easily accessible designated centres throughout the city like bus stops, hospitals, banks, etc. It will thereby reduce the efforts and resources in mask distribution. The main aim is to reduce the human contact and have a touch-free system.

Our product would be used in combination with the Android application. The user would specify the number of medical masks needed and make the payment using any of the digital payment methods. The payment feature would be a part of our application itself. A QR code generated at the user’s end would be required to get scanned at the mask dispenser machine. After successful authentication of the user, our machine circuitry would analyse the number of masks required, fetch them from the mask rack, and dispense them accordingly.

In the wake of this pandemic situation, our government is largely considering towards upgrading the society with technologically advanced solutions. In this scenario, our product would definitely help leverage the ongoing situation and ensure optimum hygiene.

This app is part of Mask dispatching machine. Which can be installed anywhere. This help is used to pay the bill of masks. After payment Qr code is generated. When this QR code is shown to machine, Machine will scan the QR code and dispatches masks. This project is selected in SSIP (Student Startup and Innovation Policy.) UPI Payment Integration is used in Android App.
